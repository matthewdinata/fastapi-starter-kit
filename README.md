# 🚀 FastAPI Starter Kit

A production-ready template for building APIs with FastAPI. Get started quickly with best practices already in place! ⚡

## 📖 Description

FastAPI Starter Kit provides a well-structured and scalable foundation for building high-performance APIs with FastAPI. It includes pre-configured best practices such as code linting, type checking, and a structured project layout to accelerate development and ensure maintainability. 🏗️

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or higher 🐍
-   pip (Python package installer) 📦
-   virtualenv or venv 🔒

### 🔧 Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux 🍏🐧
    .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows 🖥️
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

4. **Set up pre-commit hooks:**
    ```sh
    pre-commit install
    ```

### 🎯 Working with Pre-Commit Hooks

-   **Bypass hooks during commit:** 🚨

    ```sh
    git commit --no-verify
    ```

-   **Run hooks manually on all files:** 🔄

    ```sh
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

-   **Update hooks:** 🔃
    ```sh
    pre-commit autoupdate
    ```

### 🤖 CI Integration

#### GitLab CI/CD 🏗️

Add the following to `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
lint:
    script:
        - pip install pre-commit
        - pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### GitHub Actions 🚀

Include the following step in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Run Pre-Commit Hooks
  run: |
      pip install pre-commit
      pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 🔍 Code Quality

Your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` ensures that the project maintains high code quality by including:

-   **Code formatting** (black) 🎨
-   **Import sorting** (isort) 📂
-   **Linting** (flake8) 🕵️‍♂️
-   **Type checking** (mypy) 🔢
-   **Basic file checks** (trailing whitespace, YAML validation, etc.) ✅
